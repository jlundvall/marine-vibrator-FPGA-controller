This repo contains files developed in conjunction with an NTNU masters thesis.

There are two different implementations of the same simple control algorithm, one with a custom-made transfer function and one using the LabVIEW function "Discrete Transfer function Direct", shortened DTFD. The custom transfer function is also appended, along with the PI controller implementation.
